# PortSwigger Web Security Academy – Practice Notes

This folder documents my hands-on practice for web application security using PortSwigger’s labs.  
Goal: build real, repeatable skills for client work (access control, auth, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, file upload, etc.), with short, reproducible notes per lab.

**What’s here**
- ✅ Concise write-ups (problem → approach → payload → fix).
- ✅ Burp Suite/CLI commands, HTTP requests, and minimal PoCs.
- ✅ Mini “fix hints” for each issue to support reporting.

**How to read**
Each subfolder = a topic (e.g., `Access-Control/`, `Authentication/`, `XSS/`).  
Each lab file uses the template below.

> **Legal**: These are *training* labs from PortSwigger. Do not use techniques on systems you don’t own or have permission to test.
