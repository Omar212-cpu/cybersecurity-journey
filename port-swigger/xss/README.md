xss :LAB 13

i solved this one by using the repeater in burp to capture the search request and change it to a command to make an alert

LAB 14: 

 i solved this one by having a xss vulnerability in the comments so when someone opens comments the vulnerability should work , 

LAB 15:
  it had a dom xss vulneravilitiy so i just made the right js script to make the alert function

LAB 17:

solved this one i had to make the back botton gives me a document.cokkie alert . so i had to change the url of the returnpath= and put infront of it javascript.alert(1) that was a dom xss vulnerability
