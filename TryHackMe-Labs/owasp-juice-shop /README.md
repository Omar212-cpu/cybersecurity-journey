* Completed **TryHackMe â€“ OWASP Juice Shop** (walkthrough, easy) and documented a repeatable web-app testing workflow.
* Mapped endpoints, intercepted requests/cookies/JWTs, and tampered parameters & methods to validate impact.
* Exploited **reflected & DOM XSS** (e.g., `<iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">`) and confirmed execution paths.
* Verified **broken access control / IDOR** via predictable identifiers and missing server-side checks.
* Observed **excessive data exposure** in JSON responses and **unvalidated redirects/injection-style** weaknesses.
* Noted **security misconfigurations** (Score Board, verbose errors) that aid discovery and exploitation.
* Takeaways: compact XSS payload set, IDOR/BAC checklist, and tighter reproduction/reporting notes for future audits.
