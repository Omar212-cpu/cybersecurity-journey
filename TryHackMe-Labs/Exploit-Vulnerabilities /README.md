# Exploit Vulnerabilities ‚Äì TryHackMe

## üîç What I Learned

### 1. Searchsploit & Manual Research
I used `searchsploit` to locate a Python exploit for the vulnerable Online Book Store 1.0 application, demonstrating how public exploit databases complement manual vulnerability analysis.

### 2. Exploit Script Analysis
I examined the Python script to understand how it generates a random PHP file, uploads a web shell, and enables remote command execution via a `cmd=` URL parameter.

### 3. Executing a Remote Exploit
I ran the exploit against the target, successfully uploading a PHP backdoor and gaining an interactive RCE shell on the server.

### 4. Command Injection & Backdoor Usage
I leveraged a simple PHP backdoor (`<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>`) to execute system commands (e.g., `whoami`) through my browser, validating full remote takeover.

## üß† Key Takeaways
This room guided me from vulnerability discovery to practical exploitation, reinforcing the critical workflow of finding an exploit, understanding its mechanics, and executing a real-world remote code execution attack.
