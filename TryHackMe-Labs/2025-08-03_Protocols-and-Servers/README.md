# Protocols and Servers ‚Äì TryHackMe

## üîç What I Learned

### 1. Telnet Basics
Used Telnet as a general-purpose TCP client to manually interact with various application-layer protocols. Explored its capabilities on different ports, understanding the security implications of its plaintext communication.

### 2. HTTP Protocol
Manually issued HTTP requests via Telnet, gaining insight into HTTP request structures, response headers, and content types. Learned to identify server metadata and interpret raw HTTP responses.

### 3. FTP Protocol
Explored FTP's architecture by manually handling the control channel commands. Understood the distinction between control and data channels, as well as active and passive modes, to gain deeper insight into FTP operations and potential security implications.

### 4. SMTP Protocol
Learned the SMTP communication flow, issuing commands to send and manage emails manually. Understood SMTP‚Äôs response codes, interaction flow, and how mail transmission occurs at the protocol level.

### 5. POP3 Protocol
Performed manual mailbox management via POP3 commands, including listing, retrieving, and deleting messages. Grasped the protocol‚Äôs "download-and-delete" operational model.

### 6. IMAP Protocol
Explored IMAP's advanced mailbox management capabilities, including handling multiple folders, selective message retrieval, and server-side session states.

## üß† Key Takeaways
Gained hands-on understanding of critical application-layer protocols, their cleartext handshake patterns, and operational models. These insights are essential for effective reconnaissance, security assessments, and vulnerability research.
