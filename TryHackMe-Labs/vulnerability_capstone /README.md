# Vulnerability Capstone â€“ Fuel CMS 1.4.1 RCE

**Target:** Fuel CMS 1.4.1 on 10.10.236.249  
**Objective:** Achieve Remote Code Execution and retrieve the flag  

## ðŸ”§ Exploitation Steps
1. **Service Identification:** Confirmed the web application is Fuel CMS v1.4.1.  
2. **Exploit Discovery:** Used `searchsploit fuel cms 1.4.1` to locate Python (`47138.py`) and Ruby (`49487.rb`) public exploits.  
3. **Exploit Modification:** Updated the scriptâ€™s target IP to `10.10.236.249` and injected commands like `whoami` into the payload.  
4. **Remote Code Execution:** Executed the Ruby exploit (`ruby 49487.rb http://10.10.236.249 whoami`) to gain an interactive shell.  
5. **Flag Retrieval:** Navigated the file system (e.g. `/var/www/html`, `/home`) to locate and submit the flag.  

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** How to identify a vulnerable CMS version and search Exploit-DB with `searchsploit`.  
- **Manual Exploit Usage:** Techniques for reading, adapting, and running public exploit code in different languages.  
- **RCE Mechanics:** Understanding how unsanitized input can be leveraged for remote command execution.  
- **Targeted Exploitation:** Best practices for customizing exploits (IP, payload) and troubleshooting proxy or encoding issues.  
- **Post-Exploitation:** Efficient strategies for locating sensitive files and capturing flags.
