# Nmap Port Scanning – TryHackMe

## 🔍 What I Learned

### 🧩 1. What is Nmap?
- A powerful tool for network reconnaissance
- Used to find open ports and services on a host

---

### 🌐 2. TCP and UDP Ports
- **TCP**: connection-based, reliable (used for HTTP, SSH)
- **UDP**: faster, connectionless (used for DNS, video)
- Ports represent services. Can be `open`, `closed`, or `filtered`.

---

### 🚩 3. TCP Flags
| Flag | Meaning              |
|------|----------------------|
| URG  | Urgent data          |
| ACK  | Acknowledges data    |
| PSH  | Push immediately     |
| RST  | Reset connection     |
| SYN  | Start connection     |
| FIN  | End connection       |

---

### 🔁 4. TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`)
- Full 3-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)
- Unprivileged (no root required)
- Easy to detect by firewalls/IDS

---

### ⚡ 5. TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`)
- Stealth scan (SYN → SYN-ACK → RST)
- Faster and quieter
- Requires root privileges

---

### 📡 6. UDP Scan (`-sU`)
- Used for services like DNS, DHCP
- Unreliable responses: silence doesn’t mean closed
- Can be filtered silently

---

### ⚙️ 7. Scope & Performance Optimization
- `-p 1-1000` → scan specific ports
- `-T4` → speed up scan
- `-T1` → slower, stealthier
- `-Pn` → skip host discovery
- `-PR` → ARP scan on local subnet

### 📦 8. Nmap Port States
| State             | Description                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Open             | Service is listening                    |
| Closed           | Host reachable but nothing listening    |
| Filtered         | No response (likely firewall)           |
| Unfiltered       | Responds, but can’t confirm open/closed |
| Open|Filtered     | Could be either                         |
| Closed|Filtered   | Could be either                         |

### 🔐 Privileged vs Unprivileged Scans
- **Privileged (root):** SYN, ARP, raw packet scans
- **Unprivileged:** TCP Connect, slower, more detectable

## 🧠 Final Skills Gained
✅ Understood how Nmap works  
✅ Learned the difference between TCP/UDP  
✅ Practiced stealth scanning and performance tuning  
✅ Recognized port states and TCP flag usage  
✅ Used real commands like `nmap -sS`, `-sU`, `-Pn`, `-T4`
