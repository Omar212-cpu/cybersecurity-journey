# Network Security Fundamentals ‚Äì TryHackMe

## üîç What I Learned

### 1. CIA vs DAD
Explored core cybersecurity principles:
- **CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** ensures data security and reliability.
- **DAD (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction)** represents attacker objectives, targeting sensitive information and service availability.

### 2. Sniffing and MITM Attacks
Understood the mechanics of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, particularly against plaintext protocols like FTP, SMTP, and POP3. Learned defensive strategies involving encryption (TLS) and authentication via PKI certificates.

### 3. TLS / SSL Encryption
Studied how TLS encrypts traffic to prevent interception, tampering, and replay attacks, transitioning unsecured protocols to secured versions (e.g., HTTP to HTTPS, DNS to DNS-over-TLS).

### 4. Ettercap & Bettercap
Gained practical experience using Ettercap and Bettercap tools for network sniffing and MITM scenarios. Explored different interfaces (TUI, GUI, CLI, plugins) and interactive command modes for targeted network manipulation.

### 5. SSH (Secure Shell)
Practiced secure remote access with SSH, ensuring encrypted terminal communication and remote system management. Verified remote servers through SSH key fingerprints, enhancing trust and secure connectivity.

### 6. Secure File Transfer (SCP)
Used SCP over SSH to securely copy files between remote hosts, reinforcing practical encryption and secure data handling skills.

### 7. Password Brute-Forcing with Hydra
Performed brute-force password attacks against IMAP using Hydra. Learned about password list usage, command-line flags (-l, -p, -f), and interpreting failed attempts.

## üß† Key Takeaways
This session deepened my practical knowledge of defensive and offensive network security strategies, encryption standards, MITM attacks, secure remote management, and password-cracking techniques. The hands-on experience with tools like Ettercap, Bettercap, Hydra, SCP, and SSH has significantly expanded my skill set for real-world cybersecurity challenges.
