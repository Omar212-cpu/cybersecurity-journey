## Metasploit Framework – TryHackMe

Over the past session I completed three Metasploit-focused rooms, gaining end-to-end familiarity with the framework:

1. **Metasploit: Introduction**  
   Learned the core components—console, modules, payloads, and the Metasploit database. Understood how MSF organizes exploits, auxiliary tools, and post-exploitation features.

2. **Metasploit: Exploitation**  
   Practiced scanning targets, selecting and configuring exploit modules, setting payloads, and executing attacks. Became proficient at customizing options (RHOST, RPORT, payload parameters) for reliable code execution.

3. **Metasploit: Meterpreter**  
   Explored Meterpreter’s in-memory payload capabilities for post-exploitation tasks: file system navigation, process migration, credential harvesting, and pivoting. Learned best practices for stealth and session management.

These rooms reinforced both the theoretical architecture and practical workflows of Metasploit, equipping me with the skills to automate vulnerability discovery, deliver exploits, and conduct robust post-exploitation operations.
